# CatOS: _There's only one thing we gotta change: everything._

UNIX is good. UNIX is everywhere. But trash software eats away at out machines. 
Google tells you what to think. Facebook owns your every move. The industry sells good hardware meant to be trashed in 2 years.

This has gotta stop.

By 80s logic, everyone has pocket supercomputers.
We don't need your Death Star cloud. But it's futile to blow it up. You'd just build a new one.
All we need is a new OS. An OS for your phone, your PC, and for your mind.
Let the supercomputers supercompute. Both the ones in your pockets and the ones in your heads.

Thank you for your interest in my new project!
