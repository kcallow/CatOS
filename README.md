# CatOS: _The Search For Timeless (Hacker) Wisdom_

Live: http://catos.co

Computers are some of the greatest inventions of Man. With power beyond our comprehension, great ease of use, and global, instant interconnectivity, they have and will continue to change our world.

But these devices come at no small cost to society. Our limited natural resources are extracted, shaped, and refined by the hard work of countless men, women, and machines to materialize our cleverest inventions, and then distributed to every corner of the Earth, in a concerted operation requiring the greatest organization, technology, investment, and care.

It is a great shame for this effort to go to waste. The technology we love becomes trash too often. Devices that still have life in them are replaced by the new, either by desire or by obsolescence, and that which is still potentially useful is illogically discarded. It is my goal and dream to evade this, not by reinventing the wheel, but by making the old compatible with the new. How? By making the best of the old last forever.


CatOS contains what you need to learn C programming and have fun while you do it.  I included three good editors: INFOPAD (great for beginners, has syntax highlighting and mouse support), XVI (for power users, also with mouse support), and EDIT (for plain text editing).
I also included a Paint program so you can draw like a bored little kid with no Internet connection.
CatOS is based on JS-DOS and DOSPad, which are both great offshoots of DOSBox. Given that it's all DOS software, it can potentially run on any machine in use today. (An external Bluetooth keyboard is recommended for mobiles and tablets.)

Special thanks to:
-CS50 team and edX.org for teaching me good programming
-LADSoft (CC386, infopad)
-litchie (dospad)
-Chris and John Downey (xvi)
-FreeDOS (EDIT.EXE)
-John Bridges (PCPAINT)
-DOSBox developers (keep on rocking!)

Also, R.I.P. Terry A. Davis. I feel for you, but I guess I was one of the lucky ones.

Happy hacking!
