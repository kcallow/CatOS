# CatOS: _A Marriage Of Systems_

Mobile devices are one of the greatest inventions of Man. With a computing power beyond our comprehension, great ease of use, and global, instant interconnectivity, they have and will continue to change our world.

But these devices come at no small cost to society. Our limited natural resources are extracted, shaped, and refined by the hard work of countless men, women, and machines to materialize our cleverest inventions, and then distributed to every corner of the Earth, in a concerted operation requiring the greatest organization, technology, investment, and care.

It is a great shame for this effort to go to waste. The technology we love becomes trash too often. Devices that still have life in them are replaced by the new, either by desire or by obsolescence, and that which is still potentially useful is illogically discarded. It is my goal and dream to evade this, not by reinventing the wheel, but by making the old compatible with the new. How? By making the best of the old last forever.

Thank you for your interest in my new project!
